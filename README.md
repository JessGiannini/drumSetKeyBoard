# drumSetKeyBoard

## Description

This is the first of many in a Javascript challenge. This application was created with vanilla javascript and was given starter code as well as css stylings. The tutorial video demonstrated the logic needed to make the keyboard play the given sounds. I loved this activity being that I was a full time touring musician before walking the path of a programmer.

AS A musician
I WANT an easy to play drumset for creating demos
SO THAT I can create from the comfort of my home without setting up a loud drumset
```

## Mock-Up

A simple web based application that allows the user to play an electronic drumset using their keyboard.
